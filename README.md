# haveibeenpwned
HaveIBeenPwned API (Use for CLI or SIEM)

The main use case I built for this script is running employee emails through this script and outputting them to a file. You can ingest the outputted csv file into Splunk, Sentinel, AlienVault, etc. to eadd risk into RBA (Risk Based Analytics) or automatically monitoring new breaches.

You need to buy an API key from https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key.
